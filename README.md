# react-docker-starter

This is a starter template for a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project using Docker containers.

# Local development

Local development can be done isolated in docker containers so you do not need to install anything other than Docker!

1.  Navigate to the base directory
2. Run `docker-compose up dev`, this spins up a docker container which installs dependencies and runs the application
3. You can view the app by navigating to `localhost:3000`
